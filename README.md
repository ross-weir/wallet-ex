Everything about this project is WIP, including this very readme

## Seeding database with test data

In `data/db-seed.json` there is some test data that can be used to seed the database.

The entities in the seed data have all been derived using the following mnemonic:

```
change me do not use me change me do not use me
```

The wallet passwords are `testing123`.
